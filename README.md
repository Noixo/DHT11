# DHT11
Note to if anyone downloads this.

This is a working DHT11 C++ reader for the Raspberry Pi.
However, this is more of an experiment/educational thing,
(so don't laugh too hard at my poor code)
there's better and more efficient DHT11 readers out
there that you should pick above this.
I take no responsibility for anything to do with
this program.

On linux, compile with "g++ main.cpp -o DHT11 -std=c++11 -lwiringPi".
and on Visual Studio 2017, just copy paste main.cpp over the default "Blink" project...probably.
